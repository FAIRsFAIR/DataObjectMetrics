# FAIRsFAIR Metrics for assessing the FAIRness of research data objects

# Metrics Specification (v0.4)
This specification contains 17 metrics. Two metrics representing the principle A1 have been added into the specification. Metric descriptions (e.g., related resources, comments) were refined based on feedback received from external users and pilot repositories.

# Metrics Specification (v0.3)
This specification contains 15 metrics. The metric (FsF-I1-01M) from v0.2 was divided into two metrics (FsF-I1-01M and FsF-I1-02M). Metrics were improved/updated based on the focus group-based evaluation and the final version of the RDA FAIR Data Maturity Model.

# Metrics Specification (v0.2)
This is an improved version of v0.1 and was distributed to the focus group who participated in the metrics evaluation prorcess (1/5-22/5). (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3775793)

# Metrics Specification (v0.1)
This specificaiton was released as part of D4.1 Draft Recommendations on Requirements for Fair Datasets in Certified Repositories (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3678715)
